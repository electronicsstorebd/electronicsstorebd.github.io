# Electronics Store BD — Live Production Website

Live site: https://electronicsstorebd.github.io

This repository is the public source for the live Electronics Store BD website. This is not just a project demo — it represents a production storefront and customer-facing service that helps people discover products, view current offers, contact the store, and (where the site provides those features) place orders or request service.

Quick summary
- Production status: Live and customer-facing.
- Purpose: Serve product information, promotions, store details, and customer support channels.
- Hosting: GitHub Pages (this repository contains the files that power the live site).

What visitors can expect
- Curated product listings and featured items
- Current promotions, banners, and time-limited offers
- Store hours, phone, email, and directions
- Purchase flow or contact/quote/request options (if enabled on the live site)
- Clean, responsive layout optimized for mobile and desktop

Why this README has been updated
The site actively supports customers and business activity. The README now reflects that this repository is the production source for a live service (not solely a marketing demo or design prototype). Operational and contributor guidance below is written with that in mind.

For customers (short)
- Visit the live site: https://electronicsstorebd.github.io
- For orders, pickups, delivery, returns or urgent support, follow the contact methods provided on the site (phone or email) — they will be listed on the Contact / Store page.

For maintainers and contributors
- Content and layout files:
  - Home page: index.html (or the main Jekyll layout if a generator is used)
  - Static assets: assets/, css/, js/, images/ (or similar)
  - If this repo uses Jekyll, you may also see: _config.yml, _layouts/, _includes/, _posts/
- Editing content:
  - Small edits can be made directly in the GitHub web UI and committed to the default branch.
  - For larger changes, create a branch, open a PR, and coordinate merges to avoid conflicting updates during active promotions or price changes.
- Local preview:
  - Static preview: open index.html in a browser.
  - Simple local server: python -m http.server 8000 and visit http://localhost:8000
  - If the site uses Jekyll: run the usual Jekyll preview commands (bundle exec jekyll serve) — check for _config.yml first.

Operational guidance (recommended)
- Treat this repository as the single source of truth for public-facing content.
- Coordinate updates that affect prices, promotions, or service availability to avoid inconsistencies between the website and other sales channels.
- When updating images or product details, prefer optimized images to keep page load fast.
- Keep contact, hours, and location info accurate — these directly affect customer experience.

Deployment
- This repo is published via GitHub Pages. Pushing changes to the publishing branch will update the live site according to the repository's Pages configuration.
- If you want a custom domain, add a CNAME file at the repository root and configure DNS accordingly.

Security & privacy notes
- Do not store sensitive credentials, API keys, or private data in this repository.
- If the site integrates payment or customer data collection, ensure external services and data handling comply with applicable regulations and follow secure practices.

Contributing
- To propose a change: open an issue describing the change, then open a PR from a branch for code/content changes.
- For small edits, use the GitHub UI to edit and commit directly to the default branch only if you are authorized to update live content.
- For larger or structural changes, use feature branches and a PR workflow so changes can be reviewed and staged.

License
- If you want this site to be explicitly open-source, add a LICENSE file (for example, the MIT license). If a LICENSE already exists in this repository it determines reuse terms.
